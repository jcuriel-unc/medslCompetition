Description: The medslCompetition package accepts MEDSL dataverse precinct elections returns data for the purpose of
	calculating competition at the office/race level. Competition is calculated with the herfindahl index, which
	sums the squared proportions of the aggregate vote share for a given candidate running for a particular
	office. The Herfindahl index works such that when only one person runs for office, they are scored closer to
	one, and when the field is completely fragmented between numerous equally strong candidates, closer to zero.
	Note that while this package employs a number of corrections to ensure that inconsistent coding of district
	by state does nor case sensitive fields do not interefere with results, spelling errors for the fields of
	party, county, candidate, office, jurisdiction and more can still lead to problems. Additionally, district 
	magnitude higher than one can throw off results. Therefore, there is the option when appropriate to add in 
	a dataframe with the named fields of office and district so as to rank races as non-competitive whenever the
	number of candidates within a race is less than or equal to the district magnitude. Therefore, this package 
	should be used with caution when the quality of the data and/or election practices of the given race are not
	known.
